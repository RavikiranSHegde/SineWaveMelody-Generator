# SineWaveMelody-Generator

Sine Wave Melody Generator and Player
This Python project generates a melody using sine waves and plays an audio file using the Pygame library. The melody is composed of various musical notes represented by their corresponding frequencies, and each note is generated as a sine wave. The generated melody is then concatenated into a single waveform and can be played along with an audio file.

Features:

Sine Wave Generation: A function to generate sine waves at specified frequencies, durations, and sample rates.
Melody Composition: A list of musical notes is provided, each represented by its frequency in Hertz. The melody is created by concatenating the sine waves corresponding to these frequencies.
Audio Playback: Utilizes the Pygame library to load and play an external audio file while the generated melody plays.
Pygame Integration: The code initializes Pygame's mixer module to handle audio playback, allowing for the simultaneous playing of generated sine waves and an audio file.


Requirements:

pygame: For audio playback.
numpy: For mathematical operations and waveform generation.
soundfile: (Not used directly in the provided code, but often required for handling audio files.)
librosa: (Included in imports for potential audio processing, though not used in the current code.)

Notes
The current implementation is a basic example and can be extended to include more complex functionalities such as dynamic note durations, volume control, and real-time audio manipulation.
The Pygame mixer is used here for simplicity, but more advanced audio processing can be implemented with libraries like librosa or pydub.
